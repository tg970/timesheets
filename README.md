## Logging In

A user can log in or create an account using the link on the login page. New users enter their desired username, password, full name, and then have the option of being a supervisor (higher rate for billing) or an admin for the TimeSheets program. Admins for TimeSheets IO can access the reporting functionality to quickly assess any number of scenarios for the data stored from all users.

## Entering a New TimeSheet

Clicking the blue 'New TimeSheet' button on the home page leads the user to the New TimeSheet form. In the row of inputs, the user selects a Property and Activity, and then types a brief Description and the time spent on the particular activity. Once the user clicks the 'Save & New Row' button the information is stored in the database and the page re-renders with the input information as a row and a new row for input. At anytime, the user can click 'Edit' to change a previous time record. Once the user has entered all of their time for the day, they can quickly and easily click the 'Submit Time & Logout' button to log out of the program.

## Reports

By clicking the green 'Reports' button on the home page, the admin user is directed to the reports page. The user can select their criteria for their report. Then by clicking 'Run', the information matching the query is displayed.
